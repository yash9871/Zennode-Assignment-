I take full responsibility that both the tasks are solved honestly .
To run the Java and C++ files we just need to compile the files and they will work fine no need to make any kind of changes . 
You can use any online compiler and put this code straight into it and press run . 
I will recommend using this compiler becuase i have tested my code here and it works fine . (  https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler  ) 
For java copy the main.java file and for cpp use the ShoppingCart.cpp. 
Thank you.
